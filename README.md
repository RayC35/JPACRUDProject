# JPACRUDProject

## Description
This program and accompanying web site allows a user to track items in their inventory as they play the videogame DayZ. Users can search for specific items by a predetermined ID number, they may also view every item within the inventory. Users can also create and save entirely new items, as well as edit the qualities of those in the inventory.

Looking Ahead: In the future, I'd like to give users the option to sort/filter the items in their inventory, mark items that are needed, and add more details to the items. Images of inventory items should also be displayed. Furthermore, I'd like to include a game map, and allow users to note in-game locations of their characters, items, points of interests, etc.

## Difficulties and Lessons Learned
Perhaps the most obvious difficulty lay in navigating the various file types, interfaces, programs and syntax involved in this project. Throughout the development of this project, there were several moments when I had to review past lessons to remind myself how to interact with a certain set of information. At times it was also confusing understanding just how all these different sorts of files interacted with or affected one another. HTML and CSS proved particularly frustrating for me, which was surprising, because neither had given me much cause for concern, but I spent a considerable amount of time researching both and experimenting with them. At times, I took 2 or 3 days off from working on this project and quickly realized how much that affected my comfort and confidence with the material. Going forward, probably best not to let such time lapse.
